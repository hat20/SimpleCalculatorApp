# SimpleCalculatorApp
This app here is my first very simple attempt of creating a calculator. 
In this app there are two text fields in which you'll enter two numbers and then you'll be able to see the outcome as soon as
you click the button of the action you want to perform i.e. Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division.

I ran the application on -
Android Studio v3.0.1
Nexus 5X - API 24
